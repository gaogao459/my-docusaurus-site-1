# Delete Your Profile

Profile settings Delete your profile We're sad to see you go in case you still want to have access to your created scenarios. Click on your username at the bottom of the left sidebar. Select **Profile**. Under **Profile settings** in the upper-right corner, select **Profile settings >****Delete profile**.

In the pop-up that opens, you can select if you want to delete all the connections you've created. If you decide to delete your connections, all the scenarios using these connections will stop working. If you decide to keep the connections, other users in your organization will still be able to use them. Click **Delete** to confirm your decision. If you're a part of the organization with multiple users, only your profile will be deleted, not the whole organization. If you are the only user in the organization, the whole organization will be deleted together with your profile.
