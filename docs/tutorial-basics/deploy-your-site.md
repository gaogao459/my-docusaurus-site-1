# Deploy Your Site

# Deploy your site

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called ****).

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

## Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at .

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the ****).
