# Monthly And Annual Subscriptions

Subscription Monthly and annual subscriptions You can choosen between a monthly or annual subscription. ### Monthly subscription If you have a monthly subscription, your billing cycle is one month. For example, if you subscribe on 12 January, your next payment is due on 12 February. If you have a monthly subscription, you get the monthly allocation of operations in the tier you choose. ### Annual subscription If you have an annual subscription, you pay the whole yearly amount up front and we allocate all the operations that belong in the specific plan and tier you chose.

There is no monthly operations allotment, but the bulk of operations is available for you to use flexibly over the year. With the Core plan, you always have monthly allocated operations, even if you have an annual subscription. Only Pro and Teams plans have an annual package of operations. ### Change your billing cycle If you change from a monthly to an annual subscription, and vice versa, we look at your current and future operations tier.

The tier determines whether the action is an upgrade or a downgrade. Changing from a monthly to an annual subscription to an equal or higher tier is an  (e.g. changing from 10,000 per month in Pro to 120,000 per year in Pro). Changing from an annual to a monthly subscription to a lower tier is a  (e.g. changing from 240,000 operations per year in Pro to 20,000 operations per month in Pro).
