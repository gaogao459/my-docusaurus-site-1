# Cancel Your Subscription

Subscription Cancel your subscription You can cancel your subscription at any time. On the Organization dashboard, go to **Subscription > My Plan**. Click **Cancel subscription**. In a new dialog box, you will see details regarding the plan you are canceling and the features you will retain in the Free plan. Verify that you understand the changes by clicking the checkbox and then click **Continue**. The Free plan only supports one team. Select one team to retain and click **Continue**. To finalize the cancelation, you will be asked to verify that you understand that you will only have one organization under the Free plan after your cancelation date.

Additionally, if you have another Free organization, that organization will become unlicensed. Click **Cancel subscription**. We will send you a confirmation email similar to the following example: If you change your mind, you can renew your plan. ### What happens after cancelation We don't charge you for the next month, but you can still use your current subscription until the end of your billing cycle. After that, we switch you to the Free plan (assuming that you are not the owner of another organization with a Free plan).

We don't transfer your unused operations to that Free plan. You will have the standard Free subscription (i.e. 1,000 operations per month). This applies to both monthly and annual subscriptions. You can have only one free organization under your account. When you set an organization to a Free plan (either by creating a new free organization or setting a current one to free), for the next one month it is not possible to set another organization to a Free plan. If you have multiple organizations under your account and one subscription is already canceled, each subsequent organization you cancel is set as an organization without a license.

You cannot run any scenarios under this organization until you subscribe to a new plan. Always Active Clear
