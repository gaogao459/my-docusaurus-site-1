Make Managed Services (MMS) -

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Managed Services is useful to distributors that need to manage organizations on behalf of their clients, such as Make resellers or automation experts who build for organizations.

What you can do with it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Managed Services allows organizations to:

*   Create child organizations
*   Allocate and adjust operations across child organizations
*   Assign ownership of child organizations
*   Pause child organizations
*   Unlink child organizations

MMS offers separate data between child and distributor organizations, flexible operation distribution, and integrated Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities across organizations.

How it works
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Managed Services is a space in Make to manage child organizations and allocate their operations.

MMS consists of a distributor organization and its child organizations:

*   The **distributor organization** is the organization that can create and manage child organizations, assign their owners, and allocate operations.
*   The **child organization**is the organization linked to the distributor organization. Child organizations have access to all Enterprise user benefits, except for allocating their own operations. They can invite distributor organizations (including via ) to access their organization.

In this example MMS overview, RLC Inc. is the distributor organization and CD Inc., LG Inc., and MK Inc. are its child organizati ons:

Distributor organizations allocate operations to child organizations by drawing from their total operations.
