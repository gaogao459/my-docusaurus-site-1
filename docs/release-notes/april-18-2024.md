# April 18 2024

April 18, 2024 Fixed issues * When rerunning an incomplete execution caused by an error in a route in a router, only the route where the error occurred would be executed while resolving the incomplete executions. Any subsequent routes would be ignored. Now, all subsequent routes are also processed when resolving incomplete executions. * Previously, custom functions couldn't handle parameters with binary data types, such as email attachments or pictures.

This caused failures when trying to process files with custom functions. We fixed it and now you can successfully use custom functions to process raw binary data.
