# June 3 2024

June 3, 2024 Improvements and changes * We added a new read-only **Audience URI** field to the SSO settings, where you can find the path to the metadata.xml. This can be useful for setting up SSO on the provider’s side. Also, we included a link to the documentation in the SSO settings so that users can access the information more easily. Apps updates ### New apps: *  - This app helps you find potential partnerships among your customers and identify account overlap to uncover new leads and boost your sales.

*  - This AI app lets you generate responses to a prompt using a variety of large language models (LLMs). ### Updated apps: *  - It was required to enter additional credentials to create a connection before. Now you can just sign in to your Google account to work with Firebase Cloud Messaging and enjoy - In the beginning of June, Stripe will deprecate all API keys that you used to create a connection in Make. To prepare for this, we created a new connection type: Restricted API key. Don’t forget to switch to the new connection type to continue working with Stripe") - We’ve released version 2 of our Chrome app to align with the new API, so you can continue to send notifications through your browser.
