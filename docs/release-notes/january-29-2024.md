# January 29 2024

January 29, 2024 Improvements and changes * Enterprise customers can now claim and verify an email domain for their Single Sign-On (SSO) setup, allowing for SSO enforcement. Make recognizes users with the claimed email domain and prompts them to use SSO.

## See our  for information on setup and provisioning options.

* Using a coupon for a higher plan now changes your subscription. Once the coupon expires, you automatically stay on your new plan. Or, you can manually downgrade to your original plan. See our  for details. Fixed issues * Under the SSO option **Default teams for newly created users**, the list of teams showed deleted teams. This list now shows only valid teams. * It wasn't possible to delete records in a webhook queue: the **Delete** button wasn't clickable.

* The infinite scroll in the scenario history wasn't infinite: it got stuck and didn't show all records. Now you have access to the full history. * The hints for creating names of custom functions and scenario inputs were incorrect. The hints now show the correct requirements for custom function and scenario inputs names.

## * Doubled and unaligned texts appeared when you clicked the **Create a connection** button.

We solved it, so you have beautifully aligned and correct texts. * When you tried to resolve incomplete executions, the **Run once** button wasn't clickable. Also, a module that caused an error lost its mapping. We fixed both issues. * Mapping pills showed their raw name. Pills now have descriptive names.  * When you ran the **Explain flow** option and then deleted one or more modules, the dot showing the flow was stuck.

We unfroze the dot, and now it shows the full flow (and takes into account the deleted modules).  * The built-in option that Make uses to decode URLs in the output refused to decipher links. Now URLs in the output are legible and don't contain odd symbols. Always Active Clear
