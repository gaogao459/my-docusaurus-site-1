# October 5 2024

October 5, 2024 Improvements and changes * As an increased security measure, we’ve updated our process for deleting an account. Now, if you’d like to delete your account, you’ll be asked to provide the same level of verification that is required for administering your account. For example, if you have 2FA enabled, that will be required for deleting an account. * It’s now possible to add or change your payment method on the Subscriptions page. You can still add your payment method from the Organization settings dropdown as well.

* We’ve added a new section in the organization dashboard: now you can monitor all your scenarios that Make automatically disabled due to some error appeared in a scenario. Fixed issues * Users rarely couldn’t see the operation usage in their organization dashboards. This is fixed now. * Under specific conditions, the polling trigger starting point could reset to the original setting when you created the trigger. We fixed the issue, so the polling trigger metadata are always correct.

* When the HTTP module returned invalid Unicode characters after you ran the scenario manually, you couldn’t save the scenario. This is no longer happening. Apps updates ### New apps: *  - With a new Skai app, you can configure a report and run it, as well as download a report file. ### Updated apps: *  - Deals are now called Pipelines in Bigin by Zoho CRM.

Our modules have been updated to match this change. *  - The app is called **LinkedIn Conversions API** and now includes a new module, **Send Conversion Events**. Additionally, we added a new connection type that allows connecting via OpenID Connect for enhanced security. Always Active Clear
