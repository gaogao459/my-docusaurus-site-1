# February 12 2024

February 12, 2024 Improvements and changes * Using templates to create.scenarios is now much easier and more flexible. * We added an "X" icon that allows you to easily close the module settings. This means you can now open and set up modules in any order you prefer.  * We introduced badges for each module to make sure you don't miss any important information: |  | A green badge indicates that all required fields are filled in.

| | --- | --- | |  | An orange badge signals that you need to provide some additional information. | |  | A gray badge reminds you that you still need to get started with setting up the module. | Once you complete the setup and all your badges turn green, you will see a side panel that gives you the option to run, edit, or schedule your scenario.

* We renamed the **add-on apps** to **community apps**. In addition, on the Make page, we show the number of scenarios that are using the community app.  * On the Make page, we show the verification badge for Make verified apps with their author and maintainer.

This brings more clarity to who developed the app and who you should reach out to if you experience issues. Fixed issues * If a scenario contained an iterator followed by an aggregator, sometimes it would get stuck when processing a large number of bundles.

## The scenario then failed to create scenario logs.

Now scenarios run smoothly and create scenario logs. Always Active Clear
